## File Structure

- `index.php`: The main file containing the HTML structure and PHP logic for displaying and managing the to-do list.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.

## Usage

1. Open `index.php` in a web browser.
2. You will see the existing tasks listed on the page.
3. To add a new task, enter the task description in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
4. The new task will be added to the list.
5. To mark a task as completed, click the "Complete" button next to the task.
6. The completed task will be visually marked.
7. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.
8. The task will be removed from the list.

## Customize

You can customize the project according to your needs. Here are some possible customizations:

- Modify the styling in `style.css` to match your preferred design.
- Add additional fields to the task items, such as due dates or priorities.
- Implement authentication and user accounts to have personalized to-do lists.

## Limitations

- This version of the project does not include a database connection. Tasks are stored in a text file (`tasks.txt`) for simplicity. For a more robust implementation, you can integrate a database system.

Feel free to enhance the project and adapt it to your requirements.
